# Portfolio Website for Nology

## About

Our goal was to Develop a Portfolio Project. There we're some conditions to be met as listed below. Current version is First Draft and contain little to no Animations, it's not currently suited for Tablet format and plenty of work still needs to be done on final design including updating the Portfolio page once I have more projects available. I will likely add a photo of myself and rethink the Nav bar. Overall this was a great project to work on to knuckle down the fundamentals of HTML and SCSS(CSS) including large pages and small pages.

## Web Development Portfolio

- Home, About, Tech Stack, Portfolio and Tech Stack.
- Scss for styling.
- Mobile phone responsive. Tablet use is still in the works.
- First attempt using BEM naming conventions.
- Have avoided JavaScript for the project except for a tiny bit to declare the year.
